- Dungeon warfare (tower defense)
- Triple town (match 3)
- breath of fire 3, stardew valley, zelda, fate (fishing)
- Recettear (day cycle and deadline system)

### World/Environment Theme

### Objective of the Game

### Art Style
16x16 pixel art. ENDESGA 32 or DawnBringer 32 Palette.

## Mechanics


### Crafting


### World

#### Base

#### Dungeon
(dungeon)
- x by x grid where you start on one grid as go to the next
- Use Adventurers to explore

#### Agriculture
(farm)
- Farm between cycles
- Farm both plants and animals?

#### Fishing
(map of fishing locations)
- Use to pass cycle and get fish (still have to play minigame)
- Different fish in different locations? Similar to pokewalker?
(like breath of fire 3, stardew valley, zelda, fate)

#### Tower defense
(forest / mine)

#### Shop

#### Smith / Alchemy
- Craft items

### Items
- Use to upgrade town, adventures, and tower defense
- Gather from tower defense, fishing, farm, and dungeon

## Plan
- make dungeonlot first
- make farm
- tbd


## Ideas
- Use environment to help defeat enemies (difficult to beat enemies normally)
- Instead of hunger clock have slow deadly thing (plant, gas, …) grow so player must move
- Food is for bonuses only?
- Can’t die unless at 1 hp (only for weak monsters)? (or at least below a certain percentage)
- simple controls like the ground gives way
- mystry dungeon (shop in main town to prepare for dungeon, shop in dungeon to help run, )
- Ultima (Ultima like battles on stronger enemies. When ﬁghting a new character go into local geography screen)
- build main town?
- Add robo arena like gameplay somewhere?
